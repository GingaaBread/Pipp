"In this paper I intend to outline heterotopian qualities in the urban fantasy novel"
work "King Rat"

"George Orwellâ€™s 1946 essay "
work "Politics and the English Language"
" has had an enduring impact on thought about "
"the relationship between politics and language. This impact is particularly obvious in light of the various "
"critical "
"review articles that have recently referenced the essay. For example consider Mark Falcoff's 2009 article in The "
"National Review Online "
work "The Perversion of Language; or Orwell Revisited"
" in which he analyzes several common "
"words. Falcoff's close analysis of the ambiguity built "
"into political language intentionally mirrors Orwell's own point-by-point analysis of the political language of "
"his day. Even 63 years after its publication Orwell's essay is emulated by contemporary thinkers."
